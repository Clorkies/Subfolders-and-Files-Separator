# Subfolders-and-Files-Separator
### While dealing with Folders mixed with files and subfolders of some of the files: 
#### I made this program to separate the Files of the Folder and the Subfolders of the Folder.
The Files will first be placed in a Temporary Folder and afterwards the Subfolders left behind are to be moved to another Folder, namely "Excess Folders".
The Files from the Temporary Folder will then be moved back to the Source Folder.

Update: Currently broken, will fix 'soon'
